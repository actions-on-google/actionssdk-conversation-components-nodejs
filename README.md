# Actions on Google: Actions SDK Conversation Components Sample

A simple sample showing the visual conversation components available with Actions on Google.

## Setup Instructions

1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click *Create Project*.
1. Scroll down to the *More Options* section, and click on the *Conversational* card.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the `functions` folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/):
   1. Follow the instructions to [set up and initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set_up_and_initialize_functions_sdk). Make sure to select the project that you have previously generated in the Actions on Google Console and to reply "N" when asked to overwrite existing files by the Firebase CLI.
   1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL (conversationComponent): https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/conversationComponent`
1. Update the action package, `action.json`, replacing the placeholder value `YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL` with the value for Function URL obtained from the previous step.
1. [Install the gactions CLI](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli) if you haven't already.
1. Run the command, adding in your project_id `gactions update --action_package action.json --project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`
1. Return to the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com), on the left navigation menu under *Test*, click on *Simulator*.
1. Type "Talk to my test app" in the simulator, or say "OK Google, talk to my test app" to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.

For more detailed information on deployment, see the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/actions/sdk/deploy-fulfillment).

### Test on the Actions on Google simulator

1. Enable *Auto-preview changes* and Click *Test*. This will open the Actions on Google simulator.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
